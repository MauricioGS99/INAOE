\title[Job Market Candidate Profiles 2021]{SIGecom Job Market Candidate Profiles 2021}

\begin{abstract} 
This is the sixth annual collection of profiles of the junior faculty job market candidates 
of the SIGecom community. The (number TBA) candidates for 2021 are listed alphabetically and 
indexed by research areas that define the interests of the community. The candidates can be 
contacted individually or via the moderated mailing list ecom-candidates2021@acm.org.\\

% Replace CandidateFirstName and CandidateLastName with your first and last name.
% Choose some keywords (as many as you like, as long as it all fits in one line
% under the table of contents (which is, roughly, up to 70 characters).
% Replace the CandidateHomepage_URL and the CandidateCV_URL with the URL to your
% homepage and CV respectively. You can also add links to your Google scholar
% profile using the commented-out link. This is recommended, but not required.
