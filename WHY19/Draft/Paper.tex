\begin{abstract}
We define a Causal Decision Problem as a Decision Problem where available actions and outcomes are connected through the variables of a Causal Graphical Model $\mathcal{G}$ and propose a solution criteria based on Pearl's Do-Calculus and the Expected Utility criteria for rational preferences. The implementation of this criteria leads to an on-line decision making procedure that has been shown to have similar performance to classic Reinforcement Learning algorithms while allowing for a causal model of an environment to be learned.
